In addition to specifying partiality and totality, I'd also like you to specify whether a function is *injective* and/or *surjective*. An injective function is one where, if $f(x) = f(y)$, then $x = y$ for all $x$ and $y$. A surjective function is one where, if $f: X \\rightarrow Y$, then $f(X) = Y$—i.e. the *range* of $f$ is the same as its codomain; or said another way, the image of $X$ under $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ is $Y$.

In this case, I will demarcate that we want the core data of the feature valuation to be a private instance attribute `FeatureValuation._valuation` by prepending an underscore to the attribute name: when you see an underscore prepended like this, it is a convention that you should not modify its value from outside the object it is an attribute of.
