Whether or not you actually attempt Task 4, please at least read through the entire notebook to see what the task entails and how you might handle it.*\n","\n","These assignments focus on implementing a natural language inference system.

Each problem contains one or more premises and one\n","question.  There are a total of 536 premises, or an average of 1.55 premises per\n","problem.  The premise counts are distributed as follows:\n","\n","            # premises      # problems      % problems\n","            ----------      ----------      ----------\n","                1              192            55.5 %\n","                2              122            35.3 %\n","                3               29             8.4 %\n","                4                2             0.6 %\n","                5                1             0.3 %\n","\n","---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Conversion to XML by Bill MacCartney (wcmac@cs.stanford.edu).  If you benefit\n","from my work, please give me appropriate credit.\n","\n","Some notes on the XML representation:\n","\n","The 'p' and 'q' elements:\n","\n","    These contain the premises and the question from the original source\n","    problem.  Note that four problems are missing questions altogether.\n","\n","    I have made some very minor corrections here and there, such as adding\n","    missing sentence-final periods.  But I've generally been reluctant to make\n","    other edits, even when the original is not perfectly grammatical.\n","\n","The 'h' element:\n","\n","    The original problems included questions, not hypotheses.  But in my work, I\n","    prefer to work with declarative hypotheses.  I've therefore introduced the\n","    'h' element, containing a sentence which is, as nearly as possible, the\n","    declarative equivalent to the question posed in the 'q' element.  The\n","    transformation from question form to declarative form was initially\n","    performed automatically, but all the results were manually reviewed and\n","    edited for correctness.  Note that in a few questions (specifically, those\n","    containing \"any\", \"anyone\", or \"either\"), it was necessary to change some\n","    key words to achieve grammaticality.  \"Any\" and \"anyone\" were replaced by\n","    \"some\" and \"someone\", while \"either\" was replaced by \"one of the\".  Problems\n","    38, 46, 54, 55, 62, 70, 71, 78, 107, 108, 141, 344 were affected in this\n","    way.\n","\n","The 'a' element:\n","\n","    Most problems in the source document included an answer, marked in square\n","    brackets.  The 'a' element shows that answer.  Most answers are \"Yes\",\n","    \"Don't know\", or \"No\", but some are longer phrases containing qualifications\n","    or elaborations such as \"Yes, on one reading\".  The answer distribution is\n","    roughly as follows:\n","\n","        180    52%     Yes\n","         94    27%     Don't know\n","         31     9%     No\n","         41    12%     [other / complex]\n","\n","The 'why' element:\n","\n","    These elements contain text from the source document intended to explain or\n","    justify the answer.\n","\n","The 'note' element:\n","\n","    I've added notes to a number of problems in order to explain issues which\n","    arose during translation to XML.\n","\n","The 'fracas_answer' attribute:\n","\n","    To remedy the fact that the answers given in the source document are not\n","    restricted to a set of canonical values, most problems include a\n","    'fracas_answer' attribute, having one of the values {'yes', 'no', 'unknown',\n","    'undef'}.  In most cases, this attribute value was generated by the obvious\n","    mapping from the 'a' element, but for complex 'a' elements I used my own\n","    judgment in generating the 'answer' value.\n","\n","The 'fracas_nonstandard' attribute:\n","\n","    If the answer given in the source document is not one of {'Yes', 'No', or\n","    'Don't know'}, then the problem will include the 'fracas_nonstandard'\n","    attribute with value 'true'.  41 problems have this
