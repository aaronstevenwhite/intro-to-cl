This means checking whether a particular subtree (corresponding to the subject) contains a particular element. \n","\n","Let's figure out how to compute whether a tree contains a particular piece of data, and then we'll get back to figuring out how to grab the relevant subtree. \n","\n","Containment tests for a particular class (viewed as a sort of container) are often implemented in the `__contains__` magic method, which defines the behavior of `in`. The idea is that `__contains__` should take a piece of data and tell us whether it matches a piece of data somewhere in the tree. So basically, we want the analogue of asking whether a list contains some element using `in`.\n","\n","For a list, containment could be naturally implemented using a `for`-loop. So suppose we're redefining the `list` class, `__contains__` could be implemented something like this:\n","\n","```python\n","def __contains__(self, data):\n","    for d in self:\n","        if d == data:\n","            return True\n","    \n","    return False\n","```\n","\n","The way we'll implement `__contains__` for `Tree` is analogous, but we have to take into account that the tree has a more interesting structure to it. We'll do this by implementing two kinds of tree search algorithms: \n","\n","- depth-first search\n","- breath-first search\n","\n","In both kinds of search, we start at the top of the tree and work our way down, the question is which nodes we look at.\n","\n","## Depth-first search\n","\n","We'll look at two ways we can implement depth-first search: pre-order and post-order.\n","\n","### Pre-order depth-first search\n","\n","To conduct pre-order depth-first search, we start from the left-most child subtree and,\n","moving right, look at the data at the root of that subtree; then do\n","pre-order depth-first search on that subtree. \n","\n","This search path is visualized in the image below, where the line is our traversal path and the dots are wehn we look at a piece of data in a node.\n","\n","![500px-Sorted_binary_tree_preorder.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Sorted_binary_tree_preorder.svg/500px-Sorted_binary_tree_preorder.svg.png)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":8,"status":"ok","timestamp":1680619933969,"user":{"displayName":"Aaron Steven White","userId":"06256629009318567325"},"user_tz":240},"id":"D0JPInHDqOpd"},"outputs":[],"source":["from typing import TypeVar\n","\n","DataType = TypeVar(\"DataType\")\n","\n","class Tree:\n","    \"\"\"A tree\n","    \n","    Parameters\n","    ----------\n","    data\n","        The data contained in this tree\n","    children\n","        The subtrees of this tree\n","    \"\"\"\n","    def __init__(self, data: DataType, children: list['Tree']=[]):\n","        self._data = data\n","        self._children = children\n","        \n","        self._validate()\n","        \n","    def _validate(self) -> None:\n","        try:\n","            assert all(isinstance(c, Tree)\n","                       for c in self._children)\n","        except AssertionError:\n","            msg = 'all children must be trees'\n","            raise TypeError(msg)\n","        \n","    @property\n","    def data(self) -> DataType:\n","        return self._data \n","    \n","    @property\n","    def children(self) -> list['Tree']:\n","        return self._children\n","\n","    def __str__(self):\n","        if self._children:\n","            return ' '.join(c.__str__() for c in self._children)\n","        else:\n","            return str(self._data)\n","        \n","    def __repr__(self):\n","        return self.to_string(0)\n","     \n","    def to_string(self, depth: int) -> str:\n","        s = (depth - 1) * '  ' +\\\n","            int(depth > 0) * '--' +\\\n","            self._data + '\\n'\n","        s += ''.join(c.to_string(depth+1)\n","                     for c in self._children)\n","        \n","        return s\n","\n","    def __contains__(self, data: DataType) -> bool:\n","        #
