In the previous section, we introduced the formal definition of context-free grammars. Now, we'll explore various operations that can be performed on CFGs. These operations allow us to build more complex grammars from simpler ones, which is particularly useful for modeling morphological processes.

While regular languages are closed under operations like union, concatenation, and Kleene closure, context-free languages have different closure properties. Let's explore how these operations can be implemented for CFGs and what they mean for morphological analysis.

## Union

Given two context-free grammars $G_1 = (V_1, \Sigma_1, R_1, S_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, \Sigma_2, R_2, S_2)$, the union grammar $G = G_1 \cup G_2$ generates the language $L(G) = L(G_1) \cup L(G_2)$.

We can construct $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ as follows:

1. Create a new start symbol $S$ not in $V_1$ or $V_2$
2. Set $V = V_1 \cup V_2 \cup \{S\}$
3. Set $\Sigma = \Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2$
4. Set $R = R_1 \cup R_2 \cup \{S \rightarrow S_1, S \rightarrow S_2\}$

Let's implement this operation as a method in our `ContextFreeGrammar` class:

```python
def union(self, other: 'ContextFreeGrammar') -> 'ContextFreeGrammar':
    """
    Compute the union of this grammar with another grammar
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    other : ContextFreeGrammar
        The grammar to compute the union with
        
    Returns
    -------
    ContextFreeGrammar
        A new grammar generating the union of the languages
    """
    # Create a new start variable
    new_start = "S_union"
    
    # Ensure it doesn't clash with existing variables
    while new_start in self.variables or new_start in other.variables:
        new_start += "_"
    
    # Combine the variables, alphabet, and rules
    variables = self.variables | other.variables | {new_start}
    alphabet = self.alphabet | other.alphabet
    
    # Take the union of the rules
    rules = self.rules() | other.rules()
    
    # Add rules from the new start variable to the original start variables
    rules |= {
        Rule(new_start, self.start_variable),
        Rule(new_start, other.start_variable)
    }
    
    return ContextFreeGrammar(alphabet, variables, rules, new_start)
```

In morphology, union is useful for modeling alternative word formation processes. For example, we might have one grammar for noun formation and another for adjective formation, and we can combine them to create a more comprehensive morphological grammar.

## Concatenation

Given two context-free grammars $G_1 = (V_1, \Sigma_1, R_1, S_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, \Sigma_2, R_2, S_2)$, the concatenation grammar $G = G_1 \circ G_2$ generates the language $L(G) = L(G_1) \circ L(G_2)$, which consists of all strings $w_1w_2$ where $w_1 \in L(G_1)$ and $w_2 \in L(G_2)$.

We can construct $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$ as follows:

1. Create a new start symbol $S$ not in $V_1$ or $V_2$
2. Set $V = V_1 \cup V_2 \cup \{S\}$
3. Set $\Sigma = \Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2$
4. Set $R = R_1 \cup R_2 \cup \{S \rightarrow S_1 S_2\}$

Let's implement this operation:

```python
def concatenate(self, other: 'ContextFreeGrammar') -> 'ContextFreeGrammar':
    """
    Compute the concatenation of this grammar with another grammar
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    other : ContextFreeGrammar
        The grammar to concatenate with
        
    Returns
    -------
    ContextFreeGrammar
        A new grammar generating the concatenation of the languages
    """
    # Create a new start variable
    new_start = "S_concat"
    
    # Ensure it doesn't clash with existing variables
    while new_start in self.variables or new_start in other.variables:
        new_start += "_"
    
    # Combine the variables, alphabet, and rules
    variables = self.variables | other.variables | {new_start}
    alphabet = self.alphabet | other.alphabet
    
    # Take the union of the rules
    rules = self.rules() | other.rules()
    
    # Add the concatenation rule
    rules.add(Rule(new_start, self.start_variable, other.start_variable))
    
    return ContextFreeGrammar(alphabet, variables, rules, new_start)
```

In morphology, concatenation is fundamental for modeling how morphemes combine. For example, we might have a grammar for prefixes and another for stems, and concatenation allows us to model how they combine to form complex words.

## Kleene Closure

Given a context-free grammar $G = (V, \Sigma, R, S)$, the Kleene closure grammar $G^* = (V', \Sigma, R', S')$ generates the language $L(G^*) = L(G)^*$, which consists of all strings formed by concatenating zero or more strings from $L(G)$.

We can construct $G^* = (V', \Sigma, R', S')$ as follows:

1. Create a new start symbol $S'$ not in $V$
2. Set $V' = V \cup \{S'\}$
3. Set $R' = R \cup \{S' \rightarrow \epsilon, S' \rightarrow S S'\}$

Here's the implementation:

```python
def kleene_star(self) -> 'ContextFreeGrammar':
    """
    Compute the Kleene closure of this grammar
    
    Returns
    -------
    ContextFreeGrammar
        A new grammar generating the Kleene closure of the language
    """
    # Create a new start variable
    new_start = "S_star"
    
    # Ensure it doesn't clash with existing variables
    while new_start in self.variables:
        new_start += "_"
    
    # Create variables and alphabet
    variables = self.variables | {new_start}
    alphabet = self.alphabet
    
    # Copy existing rules
    rules = self.rules()
    
    # Add new rules for Kleene star
    rules.add(Rule(new_start, new_start, self.start_variable))  # S' -> S'S (repeat)
    rules.add(Rule(new_start))  # S' -> ε (empty string)
    
    return ContextFreeGrammar(alphabet, variables, rules, new_start)
```

In morphology, Kleene closure is useful for modeling repetitive affixation, such as reduplication or iterative affixes.

## Intersection

Unlike regular languages, context-free languages are not closed under intersection. This means that if $L_1$ and $L_2$ are context-free languages, $L_1 \cap L_2$ may not be context-free.

However, the intersection of a context-free language with a regular language is context-free. This property is particularly useful when we want to restrict a CFG to only generate strings that match a certain pattern described by a finite state automaton.

We won't implement intersection directly, but it's important to be aware of this closure property.

## Complementation

Context-free languages are also not closed under complementation. If $L$ is a context-free language, its complement $\overline{L} = \Sigma^* - L$ is not necessarily context-free.

## Example: Morphological Operations

Let's demonstrate these operations with a morphological example. We'll create two simple grammars: one for adjectival morphology and one for nominal morphology, and show how to combine them.

```python
# Grammar for adjectival morphology
adj_grammar = ContextFreeGrammar(
    alphabet={'happy', 'kind', 'un', 'ly'},
    variables={'Word', 'Adj', 'Adv', 'Prefix'},
    rules={
        Rule('Adj', 'happy'),
        Rule('Adj', 'kind'),
        Rule('Word', 'Adj'),
        Rule('Word', 'Adv'),
        Rule('Adj', 'Prefix', 'Adj'),  # un + happy -> unhappy
        Rule('Adv', 'Adj', 'ly'),      # happy + ly -> happily
        Rule('Prefix', 'un')
    },
    start_variable='Word'
)

# Grammar for nominal morphology
noun_grammar = ContextFreeGrammar(
    alphabet={'happy', 'kind', 'ness', 'ity'},
    variables={'Word', 'Adj', 'N', 'Suffix'},
    rules={
        Rule('Adj', 'happy'),
        Rule('Adj', 'kind'),
        Rule('Word', 'N'),
        Rule('N', 'Adj', 'Suffix'),    # happy + ness -> happiness
        Rule('Suffix', 'ness'),
        Rule('Suffix', 'ity')
    },
    start_variable='Word'
)

# Combining the grammars
combined_grammar = adj_grammar.union(noun_grammar)
```

This combined grammar would be capable of generating words like:
- "happy" (adjective)
- "unhappy" (prefixed adjective)
- "happily" (adverb)
- "happiness" (noun derived from adjective)
- "unhappiness" (noun derived from prefixed adjective)

## Implementing the Operations in the ContextFreeGrammar Class

Let's add these operations as methods to our `ContextFreeGrammar` class:

```python
class ContextFreeGrammar(ContextFreeGrammar):
    
    def __or__(self, other):
        return self.union(other)
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.concatenate(other)
    
    def union(self, other: 'ContextFreeGrammar') -> 'ContextFreeGrammar':
        """
        Compute the union of this grammar with another grammar
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        other : ContextFreeGrammar
            The grammar to compute the union with
            
        Returns
        -------
        ContextFreeGrammar
            A new grammar generating the union of the languages
        """
        # Create a new start variable
        new_start = "S_union"
        
        # Ensure it doesn't clash with existing variables
        while new_start in self.variables or new_start in other.variables:
            new_start += "_"
        
        # Combine the variables, alphabet, and rules
        variables = self.variables | other.variables | {new_start}
        alphabet = self.alphabet | other.alphabet
        
        # Take the union of the rules
        rules = self.rules() | other.rules()
        
        # Add rules from the new start variable to the original start variables
        rules |= {
            Rule(new_start, self.start_variable),
            Rule(new_start, other.start_variable)
        }
        
        return ContextFreeGrammar(alphabet, variables, rules, new_start)
    
    def concatenate(self, other: 'ContextFreeGrammar') -> 'ContextFreeGrammar':
        """
        Compute the concatenation of this grammar with another grammar
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        other : ContextFreeGrammar
            The grammar to concatenate with
            
        Returns
        -------
        ContextFreeGrammar
            A new grammar generating the concatenation of the languages
        """
        # Create a new start variable
        new_start = "S_concat"
        
        # Ensure it doesn't clash with existing variables
        while new_start in self.variables or new_start in other.variables:
            new_start += "_"
        
        # Combine the variables, alphabet, and rules
        variables = self.variables | other.variables | {new_start}
        alphabet = self.alphabet | other.alphabet
        
        # Take the union of the rules
        rules = self.rules() | other.rules()
        
        # Add the concatenation rule
        rules.add(Rule(new_start, self.start_variable, other.start_variable))
        
        return ContextFreeGrammar(alphabet, variables, rules, new_start)
    
    def kleene_star(self) -> 'ContextFreeGrammar':
        """
        Compute the Kleene closure of this grammar
        
        Returns
        -------
        ContextFreeGrammar
            A new grammar generating the Kleene closure of the language
        """
        # Create a new start variable
        new_start = "S_star"
        
        # Ensure it doesn't clash with existing variables
        while new_start in self.variables:
            new_start += "_"
        
        # Create variables and alphabet
        variables = self.variables | {new_start}
        alphabet = self.alphabet
        
        # Copy existing rules
        rules = self.rules()
        
        # Add new rules for Kleene star
        rules.add(Rule(new_start, new_start, self.start_variable))  # S' -> S'S (repeat)
        rules.add(Rule(new_start))  # S' -> ε (empty string)
        
        return ContextFreeGrammar(alphabet, variables, rules, new_start)
```

With these operations, we can build complex morphological grammars from simpler components, modeling the rich combinatorial properties of morphological systems.

## Real-World Example: CELEX Morphological Data

The CELEX database provides rich morphological analyses of words in English, German, and Dutch. Using our operations, we can model the morphological processes reflected in this dataset.

Let's look at how we might build a grammar for a subset of English derivational morphology based on CELEX data:

```python
def extract_rules_from_celex(parsed_words):
    """
    Extract CFG rules from a collection of parsed words from CELEX
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    parsed_words : list of ParsedWord
        List of words with their morphological analyses
        
    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        (alphabet, variables, rules)
    """
    alphabet = set()
    variables = set()
    rules = set()
    
    for word in parsed_words:
        # Add morphemes to alphabet
        for _, morpheme in word.flatten():
            alphabet.add(morpheme)
        
        # Add categories to variables
        for tag, _ in word.flatten():
            variables.add(tag)
        
        # Extract rules
        for rule in word.rules:
            rules.add(rule)
    
    return alphabet, variables, rules

# Assuming we have the parsed words from CELEX
alphabet, variables, rules = extract_rules_from_celex(celex_parses.parsed_word.values)
celex_grammar = ContextFreeGrammar(alphabet, variables, rules, "WORD")

# We can now use our operations to build more complex grammars
# For example, we might create a grammar specifically for derivation with the prefix "un-"
un_rules = {r for r in rules if "un" in r.right_side}
un_variables = {r.left_side for r in un_rules} | {r.right_side[i] for r in un_rules for i in range(len(r.right_side)) if r.right_side[i] in variables}
un_alphabet = {r.right_side[i] for r in un_rules for i in range(len(r.right_side)) if r.right_side[i] not in variables}
un_grammar = ContextFreeGrammar(un_alphabet, un_variables, un_rules, "WORD")

# And a grammar for derivation with the suffix "-ness"
ness_rules = {r for r in rules if "ness" in r.right_side}
ness_variables = {r.left_side for r in ness_rules} | {r.right_side[i] for r in ness_rules for i in range(len(r.right_side)) if r.right_side[i] in variables}
ness_alphabet = {r.right_side[i] for r in ness_rules for i in range(len(r.right_side)) if r.right_side[i] not in variables}
ness_grammar = ContextFreeGrammar(ness_alphabet, ness_variables, ness_rules, "WORD")

# Combining the grammars
un_ness_grammar = un_grammar.union(ness_grammar)
```

This would create a grammar capable of generating words with "un-" and "-ness" affixes, such as "unhappiness."

In the next section, we'll explore how to convert context-free grammars to normal forms, particularly Chomsky Normal Form, which simplifies parsing algorithms.
