@jurafsky_speech_2023[Ch. 2.1] on regular expressions. 
:::

In the last submodule, we defined the set of strings on an alphabet $\Sigma$ as:

$$\Sigma^* = \bigcup_{i=0}^\infty \Sigma^i$$

We then defined a language $L$ on $\Sigma$ to be some (possibly improper) subset of the set of strings:

$$L \subseteq \Sigma^*$$

The set of all languages on $\Sigma$ is thus the powerset $2^{\Sigma^*}$ of the set of strings $\Sigma^*$.

In this submodule, we're going to discuss one way that we can compactly describe (a subset of) the languages in $2^{\Sigma^*}$: *regular expressions*. 

Regular expressions are foundational both from an applied and from a scientific perspective. From an applied perspective, they allow us to effectively query and modify text in a compact programmatic way. From a scientific perspective, they provide a way of stating phonological grammars in an efficient way.
