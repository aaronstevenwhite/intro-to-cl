In this course, we won't spend too much time with these sorts of objects, but it's useful to know the terminology.\n","\n","Multisets are often (somewhat confusingly) represented using the same notation as sets. For instance, the following is a multiset containing only vowels.\n","\n","$$\\bar{V}_1 \\equiv \\{\\text{e, i, o, u, æ, ɑ, ɔ, ə, ɛ, ɪ, ʊ}\\}$$\n","\n","And this is a representation of the same multiset, since multisets are unordered.\n","\n","$$\\bar{V}_2 \\equiv \\{\\text{o, u, æ, ɑ, ɔ, ə, ɛ, ɪ, ʊ, e, i}\\}$$\n","\n","But this is not a representation of a multiset, since multisets are nonuniqued.\n","\n","$$\\bar{V}_3 \\equiv \\{\\text{o, o, o, u, u, æ, ɑ, ɔ, ə, ə, ə, ɛ, ɪ, ʊ, e, i}\\}$$\n","\n","Another way of saying this is that the [*multiplicity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(mathematics)) of a particular element matters in a multiset in a way it doesn't matter in a set.\n","\n","We often work with multisets in Python using [`dict`s](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) or specialized subclasses thereof. One special subclass of `dict` that is useful for representing multisets (and that you should know) is [`collections.Counter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter). \n","\n","The nice thing about `Counter` is that it can be initialized with an iterable or mapping (such as a `set`) containing hashable objects (such as `str`s) and it will make a dictionary mapping the elements of that iterable/mapping to their multiplicity–i.e. how many times they show up in that iterable/mapping.[^Note that I'm passing the vowels in the multiset as a `list` to `Counter`. We crucially don't want to pass them as a `set`, because that would destroy the multiplicities of the items.]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Counter({'e': 1,\n","         'i': 1,\n","         'o': 1,\n","         'u': 1,\n","         'æ': 1,\n","         'ɑ': 1,\n","         'ɔ': 1,\n","         'ə': 1,\n","         'ɛ': 1,\n","         'ɪ': 1,\n","         'ʊ': 1})\n"]}],"source":["from pprint import pprint\n","from collections import Counter\n","\n","vowels_bar_1: Counter[str] = Counter(\n","    [\"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\", \"æ\", \"ɑ\", \"ɔ\", \"ə\", \"ɛ\", \"ɪ\", \"ʊ\"]\n",")\n","\n","pprint(vowels_bar_1)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Counter({'o': 1,\n","         'u': 1,\n","         'æ': 1,\n","         'ɑ': 1,\n","         'ɔ': 1,\n","         'ə': 1,\n","         'ɛ': 1,\n","         'ɪ': 1,\n","         'ʊ': 1,\n","         'e': 1,\n","         'i': 1})\n"]}],"source":["vowels_bar_2: Counter[str] = Counter(\n","    [\"o\", \"u\", \"æ\", \"ɑ\", \"ɔ\", \"ə\", \"ɛ\", \"ɪ\", \"ʊ\", \"e\", \"i\"]\n",")\n","\n","pprint(vowels_bar_2)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Counter({'o': 3,\n","         'ə': 3,\n","         'u': 2,\n","         'æ': 1,\n","         'ɑ': 1,\n","         'ɔ': 1,\n","         'ɛ': 1,\n","         'ɪ': 1,\n","         'ʊ': 1,\n","         'e': 1,\n","         'i': 1})\n"]}],"source":["vowels_bar_3: Counter[str] = Counter(\n","    [\"o\", \"o\", \"o\", \"u\", \"u\", \"æ\", \"ɑ\", \"ɔ\", \"ə\", \"ə\", \"ə\", \"ɛ\", \"ɪ\", \"ʊ\", \"e\", \"i\"]\n",")\n","\n","pprint(vowels_bar_3)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["And `Counter`s behave as we would expect of a multiset–at least in terms of equality.
