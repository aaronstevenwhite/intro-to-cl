This terminology arises from the fact that, if $\\Sigma$ were, say, all of the phonemes of English, at least one element of $2^{\\Sigma^*}$ would be all and only the words of English (or at least one persons English idiolect). If $\\Sigma$ were all English words (and assuming that _grammaticality_ is a coherent binary concept), at least one element of $2^{\\Sigma^*}$ would be all the grammatical sentences of English (or at least one persons English idiolect). Of course, many of the sets in $2^{\\Sigma^*}$ won't look anything like English or any other languages, and a big part of this class is going to be figuring out how to find subsets of $2^{\\Sigma^*}$ that look like possible languages.\n","\n","Because $\\{s\\} \\in 2^{\\Sigma^*}$ for all $s \\in \\Sigma^*$, we know that $2^{\\Sigma^*}$ must be at least as large as $\\mathbb{\\Sigma}^*$, which is the same size as $\\mathbb{N}$.

What we'll do is view each language as an infinite string of 1s and 0s, where the $j^{th}$ element for a language is $1$ if the string is in the language and $0$ otherwise. If the size of $2^{\\Sigma^*}$ were the same as $\\Sigma^*$ and $\\mathbb{N}$, then we should be able to stack all of these infinite 1-0 (i.e. binary) sequences together into a matrix $\\mathbf{B}$, where the $j^{th}$ column tells us for each language $i$ along the rows, whether that language contains string $S(j)$. That would be an enumeration of the languages because each language would have its own row.\n","\n","Notice, though, that the language corresponding to the sequence $l_j = \\begin{cases}1 & \\text{if } b_{jj} = 0\\\\0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$ cannot be in this enumeration because it differs from every language in the enumeration by at least one string: for language $j$, string $S(j)$.
